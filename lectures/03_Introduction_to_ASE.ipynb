    "ASE has the ability to attach a \"calculator\" to an atoms object. At a fundamental level, these are just classes that will return energies and forces. That means it can be a DFT program, a quantum chemistry program, or even just a classical potential like \"Leonard-Jones\" There are [a ton](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html) of calculators implmented. Here we will just use a simple one, the [EMT](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/emt.html) calculator.\n",

    "The `EMT` calculator is just a simple pair potential calculator for a few metals. In practice it is a toy calculator used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start by making an instance of your calculator, then using `set_calculator` to attach it to an atoms object. Once that is done you can call `get_potential_energy` and `get_forces` to calculate the energy and forces."

However, it is very fast, so it allows us to see the principles behind how reaction energies can be computed. If we want accurate numbers, we need to use quantum mechanics, approximated through Density Functional Theory (DFT). This will be much more computationally expensive, and will require a supercomputer. You will learn more about this in future lessons."
