Team members range from sophomores through graduate students, from first-time participants to students who have been involved for four or more semesters. Some students take the course for one credit, and others take it for two credits; naturally, the bar will be higher for those taking it for two credits."

The projects will generally be associated with initiating new research projects or wrapping up ongoing projects from prior semesters. Independent study projects are typically high risk and/or require significant prior experience, so they will generally be reserved for more senior and returning students."

    "\n",
    "### Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Adsorption energies of molecules on solid surfaces are extremely challenging to measure experimentally, but they can be computed with DFT at a significant computational cost. The [\"Open Catalyst Project\"](https://opencatalystproject.org/) has curated two datasets and associated baseline machine-learning models for predicting adsorption energies. The \"OC20\" dataset is an extremely large dataset including a broad class of materials, while the OC22 dataset is somewhat smaller and focuses on oxide materials (a materials class that is particularly challenging to simulate). There are a number of specific tasks and a leaderboard for each dataset with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models created by major computer science companies including Meta and Microsoft as well as numerous academic groups. The goal of this sub-team is to build, test, and improve machine-learning models for this important benchmark dataset. Some examples of project directions could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Developing AMPTorch and GMP models\n",
    "The [AMPTorch code](https://github.com/ulissigroup/amptorch) is co-developed by the Medford and Ulissi groups, and includes a unique featurization scheme called \"Gaussian Multipole Features\". These features have [shown promising performance for OC20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02390), especially for smaller datasets. They have far fewer fitted parameters than more complex models, and thus may not be able to compete for very large datasets, but still have some advantages in terms of speed and small datasets. Some specific tasks that could be investigated include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimizing AMPTorch+GMP models through hyperparameters of the features and neural net architectures to improve performance.\n",
    "* Creating and testing AMPTorch+GMP models for the OC22 benchmark.\n",
    "* Implementing the infrastructure needed to place AMPTorch+GMP models onto the official Open Catalyst leaderboard.\n",
    "* Improvements in computational efficiency and memory management of the AMPTorch code (especially parallelizing training to multiple GPU nodes).\n",
    "* Testing how GMP features work with more complex machine-learning model architectures such as graph convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing state-of-the-art models\n",
    "The Open Catalyst leaderboard is constantly evolving with new state-of-the-art models that utilize cutting edge concepts like graph neural networks and transformers. In principle, these models may be capable of accelerating many research tasks within the Medford group. However, installing these models on Georgia Tech infrastructure and applying them to new problems outside the OCP benchmarks often requires sigificant software troubleshooting. Some specific tasks to be investigated include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Installing SOTA models on PACE and repeating the benchmark tests for sub-sets of the OC20 set to check the time required for inference.\n",
    "* Applying SOTA models to new adsorption predictions that are of interest to the Medford group.\n",
    "* Creating infrastructure for [\"fine tuning\"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ac8fe0) of models to accelerate geometry optimizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating general data infrastructure\n",
    "There are some tasks associated with training atomistic machine-learning models that are agnostic to the details of the models being used or trained. Developing software and infrastructure to help with these tasks will be broadly beneficial for many of the other tasks mentioned above. Some specific examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Infrastructure for automating and accelerating the optimization of hyperparameters for neural network models and atomistic features.\n",
    "* Algorithms for stratified sub-sampling of massive datasets to create more representative sub-samples that facilitate faster model optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanical simulations are critical for understanding materials, and DFT is especially impactful owing to its tradeoffs in speed/scalability and accuracy. However, even DFT has limitations in terms of system size owing to the computational scaling that increases approximately as $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ where $N$ is the number of electrons. One route to overcoming this limitation is computational parallelization, allowing much larger systems to be studied by using more computational power. The [SPARC DFT code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10431), developed by Prof. Suryanarayana at Georgia Tech, is able to achieve faster wall times than any other code in the limit of large numbers of processors, making it an ideal platform for implementation of new methods and studying realistic systems. However, there are many outstanding challenges in improving and applying the code. Some examples of project directions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improving the user friendliness of the SPARC code\n",
    "The SPARC code has [documentation](https://github.com/SPARC-X/SPARC/tree/master/doc) and a [Python API](https://github.com/SPARC-X/sparc-dft-api), but there is room for improvement in both areas. Creating new examples and tutorials would also be useful. Some specific tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically linking the SPARC documentation to the Python API (e.g. have doc strings for functions that automatically update from the SPARC docs).\n",
    "* Streamlining the Python API code to be better organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "* Creating a Jupyter Book with specific tutorials on how to utilize various features of SPARC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Developing pseudopotentials and associated infrastructure\n",
    "Pseudopotentials (PSPs) are a critical part of DFT calculations, and the SPARC code requires a specific type of \"norm conserving\" PSPs. The Suryanarayana and Medford groups have worked together to [apply evolutionary algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09806) to help accelerate the process of psuedopotential development, leading to a new library of \"SPMS\" PSPs. However, these PSPs are focused on a specific exchange-correlation functional type (GGA) and could be tweaked in many ways. Moreover, an improved system for organizing and disseminating these PSPs would be impactful. Some specific tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning to apply the genetic algorithm and using it to optimize other PSP formats.\n",
    "* Creating a website to help visualize and organize PSP libraries (similar to [this example](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/)).\n",
    "* Systematic testing of the speed and accuracy of different types/libraries of PSPs for various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying and benchmarking methods in SPARC\n",
    "There is an ever-evolving list of new exchange-correlation functionals and other methods that are being implemented in SPARC. These new methods enable the study of various material and chemical phenomena, although benchmarking is often required to establish accuracy. Some specific tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applying SPARC to study a specific material or chemical problem of interest.\n",
    "* Comparing the speed and accuracy of different methods within SPARC to a specific problem."
