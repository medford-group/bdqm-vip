Team members range from sophomores through graduate students, from first-time participants to students who have been involved for four or more semesters. Some students take the course for one credit, and others take it for two credits; naturally, the bar will be higher for those taking it for two credits."

The projects will generally be associated with initiating new research projects or wrapping up ongoing projects from prior semesters. Independent study projects are typically high risk and/or require significant prior experience, so they will generally be reserved for more senior and returning students. Students from previous semesters who were part of a sub-team that no longer exists may continue their work as an independent study project as well (one month prior discussion not necessary)."

    "\n",
    "Additional details and broader context for the overarching goals of each sub-team, along with possible ideas of individual tasks, are provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DFT Modeling of Surface Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most popular computational approaches used in various fields due to its high accuracy in simulating atomistic models. In this project, we will go beyond the scope of the training materials and apply DFT to study fascinating surface reactions. While prior knowledge of these topics is not required, an interest in the computational investigation of chemical reactions is necessary, as the project will involve greater complexity in both DFT and chemistry. DFT calculations will be conducted using SPARC code. The SPARC DFT code, developed by Prof. Suryanarayana at Georgia Tech, was designed to be used for the massive parallel calculations. Additionally, the project will encompass testing SPARC code and improving the Python API for the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investigating surface reactions\n",
    "DFT is a powerful tool for predicting what is going to happen in the system of interest. However, its reliability depends on how the calculations is done. This approach will involve:\n",
    "* Setting up the realistic surface models, which are crucial for obtaining accurate results\n",
    "* Predicting the surface reactions that are likely to occur under actual conditions\n",
    "* Analyzing the calculation results using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Utilizing SPARC DFT code\n",
    "The SPARC code is a newly developed DFT packages, and as such, it offers opportunities for further refinement through our contribution. The tasks will include:\n",
    "* Testing new features in SPARC\n",
    "* Enhancing the Python API for SPARC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning for Catalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogenous catalysis is the staple of the modern chemical industry. However, many of the catalysts in use today were discovered decades ago. Computational tools, such as DFT, offer a promising route to rational design of novel catalysts with enhanced properties. The cost of DFT limits the search space that can be stuided computationally. Further, the methods for screening catalysts based on DFT calculations often rely on certain assumptions, including an active site(s), orientation of molecule, neglecting adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, approximations to thermal corrections etc... These limit the accuracy and applicability of DFT studies. ML methods have emerged as a promising complement to traditional DFT calculations. The SOTA models developed by Meta for predicting energies and forces can acclerate DFT screenings by as much as 2000x. These results can be used to identify promising candidate catalyst materials given the assumptions enumerated above. We hypothesize that LLMs fine-tuned on the catalysis literature and expert knowledge can be used to automate and improve the robustness of computational screening procedures by extracting knowledge from the wealth of scientific literature. This is a largely unexplored area, as LLMs have only recently been applied to solving problems in chemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning GPT models for Catalysis\n",
    "LLMs are transforming how scinece is done. We aim to harness the power of open-access models trained by Meta (or others) to solve problems in the field of catalysis. Specific tasks for students will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning to interact with LLMs via APIs \n",
    "* Developing infrastructure for fine-tuning GPTs with computational catalysis literature on PACE\n",
    "* Construction of development environment for rapid iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Developing a portable and easily customizable platform for training NNs\n",
    "The machine learning literature evolves at a blistering rate. As a result, it is imperative to have a platform for implementing and testing SOTA methods rapidly. Existing platforms for training NNFFs tend to be clunky, involving \"bleeding\" edge dependencies that often break and result in headaches in installation. Further, efforts to optimize the training procedures result in code that is difficult to modify or customize. The goal here is to develop a lightweight, portable platform for training NNs on chemistry data. Specific tasks will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Utilizing an autograd package as a base for a NN training package\n",
    "* Developing highly modular python code with minimal dependencies and an emphasis on readability and portability\n",
    "* Extending NN training procedure to tasks outside of traditonal force field development (i.e., exchange correlations)"
