The following papers and resources are useful if you would like to get a head-start on the training semester, or if you are looking for more fundamental details of the topics covered in the course:

### Density Functional Theory

* A relatively short "perspective review" to get some quick theoretical background: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4704546
* A comprehensive textbook with a lot of practical details: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470447710
* A free online "textbook" with even more practical details and examples: http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html
