Course Description
==================

About VIP
---------

The Vertically-Integrated Projects (VIP) Program operates in a research
and development context. Undergraduate students that join VIP teams earn
academic credit for their participation in design/discovery efforts that
assist faculty and graduate students with research and development
issues in their areas of expertise.

The teams are:

-   Multidisciplinary - drawing students from all disciplines on campus;

-   Vertically-integrated - maintaining a mix of sophomores through PhD
    students each semester;

-   Long-term - each undergraduate student may participate in a project
    for up to three years and each graduate student may participate for
    the duration of their graduate career.

The continuity, technical depth, and disciplinary breadth of these teams
are intended to: Provide the time and context necessary for students to
learn and practice many different professional skills, make substantial
technical contributions to the project, and experience many different
roles on a large, multidisciplinary design/discovery team. Support
long-term interaction between the graduate and undergraduate students on
the team. The graduate students mentor the undergraduates as they work
on the design/discovery projects embedded in the graduate students’
research. Enable the completion of large-scale design/discovery projects
that are of significant benefit to faculty members’ research programs.

About Big Data and Quantum Mechanics
------------------------------------

This course explores projects at the intersection of computational
chemistry (quantum mechanics) and data science (big data) within the
application domain of surface science and catalysis. The team merges
expertise from computational and physical sciences, and students from
computer science, electrical engineering, industrial & systems
engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials
science. The VIP course consists of three sub-teams:

-   Training (led by Logan Brabson): All new students must complete a training program that
    involves the basics of high-performance computing, common quantum-mechanical techniques
    such as Density Function Theory (DFT), and the development and use of machine learning 
    techniques such as neural networks. DFT software packages are well-established, but 
    require the use of supercomputing resources and must be converged with respect to
    several numerical parameters. The training will cover approximately 10 weeks and is
    highly represnetative of training programs for new graduate students in this field.

-   LUCAS GROUP (led by Lucas Timmerman): EDIT HERE This sub-team will focus on training
    machine-learning models to reproduce the output of DFT calculations.
    In particular, this team will utilize a variety of available technology to
    train and optimize models for the "[Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/)"
    challenge datasets. This may involve sub-tasks like testing the performance
    of new models, optimization of hyper-parameters, establishing smaller sub-sampled 
    datasets for rapid testing, or developing new infrastructure to make
    data transfer and model deployment more efficient.

-   NEUNG-KYUNG GROUP (led by Neung-Kyung Yu): EDIT HERE This sub-team will focus on applying and improving
    the [SPARC DFT code](https://www.sparc-x.com/) developed at Georgia Tech. 
    This may involve sub-tasks like developing new features for the Python
    interface to SPARC, testing recently developed algorithms in SPARC,
    creating pseudopotentials that enable faster and more accurate calculations
    with SPARC, or developing websites and infrastructure to make SPARC
    easier to use.

Returning VIP students who previously started work on a project may choose to continue 
building on their existing work isntead of joining one of the above subgroups.
If you are a returning student and are interested in an "independent study" project you should
contact Dr. Medford as soon as possible to initiate discussions on what is within scope for
the course and what is feasible given timelines and resources.

Course Logistics
================

The course will utilize the following resources for communication and
submission of assignments:

-   Github: All course materials will be posted to Github.

-   Canvas: The course Canvas site will be used for submission of
    assignments and peer grading.

-   Slack: The group Slack channel is the preferred method of
    communication with instructors and graduate students. You are
    responsible for anything that is announced in the `vip`
    Slack channel. You can join the Slack channel via [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/medfordgroup/shared_invite/zt-uj1pt7d3-TTF9QNEkhfmRELNy7lM3oA).

Course Objectives
=================

1.  Generate atomistic simulation and adsorption energy data using density functional theory (DFT)

2.  Converge numerical calculations with respect to input parameters

3.  Submit, manage, and analyze high-performance computing jobs

4.  Utilize machine-learning packages to model and predict the output of atomistic
    simulations

5.  Work with a team to solve real-world problems at the intersection of
    big data and quantum mechanical simulations

Course Structure
================

The grade will be assigned based on three categories:

-   Documentation: 33.3 %

-   Personal Accomplishments: 33.4 %

-   Teamwork and Interactions: 33.3 %

A grade of 0-5 will be assigned for each category based on the criteria
outlined below. A total grade will be computed based on the weighted
average of the 3 categories which will be converted to letter grades
using the following:

-   A: > 4

-   B: > 3

-   C: < 3

-   D: < 2

You will receive a grade at the midterm and after the end of the course.
Both grades will average to determine your final letter grade.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation grade will be assessed based on bi-weekly updates submitted via Canvas.
The weekly update should include the following components:

- Tasks completed in the prior week
- Discussion of any key challenges or results
- Tasks to be completed in future weeks
- Documentation needed to repeat analysis and access results
- A literature review of at least one paper that you read or used during the weeks (see [literature review lecture](https://github.com/medford-group/bdqm-vip/blob/master/lectures/01_Projects_and_Literature_Searching.ipynb))


Documentation for the bi-weekly updates should be provided as a text file or Word document.
Bi-weekly updates will be peer graded on a scale of 0-5 based on the following criteria (decimal scores are allowed):

-   5: Remarkable progress on tasks, clear description of process and findings, a well-defined plan for the next weeks, and relevant citations (A+)

-   4: Average progress on tasks, some documentation of results/challenges, a reasonable plan for the coming weeks, and relevant citation (A)
Goals are completely achieved (A)

-   3: Some progress on tasks, but documentation and/or plan is lacking detail. A citation is provided, but lacks relevance or appears to be re-used (B)

-   2: Very little progress on tasks, documentation and/or plan is omitted or incomplete. Citation lacks relevance or is omitted (C)

-   1: Clear lack of effort in completing tasks, documentation and plan are omitted or irrelevant. Citation not provided (D)

-   0: No submission

Bi-weekly updates should be compiled into a single document and submitted at the midterm and final. Instructors will review the average score from bi-weekly updates and compare this to the compiled updates to ensure that the peer grading is appropriate, and to ensure that citations are not recycled. Instructors reserve the right to revise the average score up or down if substantial inconsistencies between the score and the criteria above are observed.

Personal Accomplishments
------------------------

Personal accomplishments will be measured by self-defined goals and a
combination of instructor and peer evaluation. Within the **first three weeks**
of the semester students will define midterm and
semester goals for their specific tasks within their sub-team. 
Each goal should have a deliverable
that can be unambiguously evaluated as complete or incomplete (computer
code, report, figure, etc.), and each student should submit a
deliverable. Deliverables submitted by team members need not be unique,
but self-defined goals should be individualized, such that each
team member has different deliverables that support a larger team-based
goal.

-   5: Goals are completely achieved and additional progress has been
    made (A+)

-   4: Goals are completely achieved (A)

-   3: Goals are partially achieved (B)

-   2: Some progress has been made, but goals are not achieved (C)

-   1: No substantial progress is made towards goals (D)

Similar to documentation, the accomplishments will be graded by your peers, and confirmed by the
instructor. Importantly, the midterm assessment is only advisory, and
students have an opportunity to **revise goals within 2 weeks of
receiving the midterm assessment**.
The final grade will depend only on the revised goals. This means that
the grade is controlled by two factors: i) ability to plan research and
set realistic targets and ii) ability to achieve goals and deliver on a
plan.

Goals and deliverables for the training team will be provided
by instructors and are known to be achievable based on many prior years
of experience.


#### Submission and peer review:

The accomplishments will be initially graded by multiple peers and
confirmed by the instructor. The deliverables will be submitted via
Canvas as a .zip file, and a copy of the project goals document should
be included with the submission to aid the reviewers. 
**All submissions should contain a file named "README"** that explains the
accomplishments in the context of the project goals and points the reviewer
to necessary information.
Any external deliverables (e.g. websites, Github, etc.) should be
clearly referenced. The README can also contain any comments, instructions, or
context that may be important for a grader. When grading other students’
assignments you should use the above 1-5 scale and criteria as a
guideline. Only materials included in or referenced in the submission
should be used to assess the criteria (e.g. if a group presents
something in the VIP meeting but does not include it in the submission
then it does not count).

Teamwork and Interaction
------------------------

Teamwork and interaction will be graded based on peer evaluations
conducted through the VIP website and your participation in peer grading.
Note that this can be confusing. **Peer evaluations** occur twice per
semester through the VIP website, while **peer grading** occurs bi-weekly for
documentation and twice per semester for personal achievements.
The **response rate for peer grading and peer evaluations will account 
for 40% of the teamwork and interaction grade.**, while the scores you receive
from your teammates in the peer evaluation will account for the other 60% of
this grade. Note that you **only need to complete peer evals for your sub-team members**,
but **peer grading will be across different subteams** and will be explicitly
assigned.

Course Format
-------------

The course will by offered in a hybrid, flipped classroom format. We have multiple online MS students who work in the course, so it is important to provide a mechanism for remote participation. For this reason, we will pre-record training lecture videos and use the course time to meet and discuss the training materials or individual projects.
