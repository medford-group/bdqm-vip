# Big Data and Quantum Mechanics Traning Project
Advisors: Logan Brabson

This project covers basic training for 1) generating data using quantum-mechanical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) and 2) using machine learning to create models..


## Midterm Goal:
Complete all assigned training materials. See the VIP specific page in the training materials [jupyter book](https://medford-group.github.io/training-materials) for which lectures and exercises need to be completed. 


### Midterm Deliverables:
* A .zip file containing pdfs of all jupyter notebooks (with solutions printed) demonstrating completion of the training exercises.

## Final Goal:
You need to join on of the sub-teams by the end of the semester. You should become familiar with the ongoing work and select a project that you would like to continue working on in future semesters. 

### Final Deliverables:
* Completion of biweekly updates and peer evaluations
* You should meet with the TA in charge of the sub team you joined at least once prior to the conclusion of the semester to discuss your interests and ideas for future project work
